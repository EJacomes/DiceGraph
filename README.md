# DiceGraph
Hello everyone, I'm finally back with a new personal project to share with y'all! I have been planning on doing this idea I had for a while now but University kept me busy but now that summer vaction is here, I finally did it!
The program called DiceGraph is program that takes two dices (Dice.java) and rolls them for a set amount of time that the user wants before graphing out the rolls to see which rolls had the most amount of rolls and the least amount of rolls and all inbetween
